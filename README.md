I have been having so much fun making AI graphics with [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com) that I decided to make a fun little website using some of the images I created. It is a single page for now, but I hope to expand it when the Midjourney API allows us to query for top images as rated by the community. It is a React project utilizing [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) version 13. It uses Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for styling and animation.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
